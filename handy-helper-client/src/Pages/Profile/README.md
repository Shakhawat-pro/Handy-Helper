**Edit Profile Component**

### Description:
The Edit Profile component is a React component responsible for allowing users to update their profile information. It provides a form interface where users can modify their name and profile picture.

### Functionality:
1. **User Context**: The component utilizes React context to access the currently authenticated user's information.
2. **State Management**: It uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the profile picture URL.
3. **Form Submission**: When the user submits the form, the component triggers the `handleSubmit` function, which updates the user's profile information.
4. **Profile Update Confirmation**: Before updating the profile, the component displays a confirmation dialog using the SweetAlert2 library.
5. **Profile Update**: Upon confirmation, the component calls the `updateProfile` function from Firebase Authentication to update the user's display name and profile picture URL.
6. **Validation**: The form fields for the name and profile picture URL are required, and appropriate validation messages are displayed if the user attempts to submit the form without filling in these fields.
7. **Preview Profile Picture**: The component displays a preview of the current profile picture or the selected image URL using the `FaUpload` icon from the React Icons library.

To use the Edit Profile component, simply import it into your project and include it in a suitable location where users can access their account settings.
